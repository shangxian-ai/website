# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the official website for 尚贤智启 (Shangxian AI), an AI education technology company. The website showcases the company's profile, products, solutions, philosophy, and partnerships. The main homepage (`docs/index.html`) is automatically generated by AI using the content provided in the root `README.md` file.

## Repository Structure

```
/
├── README.md           # Source content for website generation (Chinese)
├── docs/               # Website files for GitHub Pages
│   ├── index.html      # AI-generated homepage based on README.md
│   └── CNAME           # Custom domain configuration (www.shangxian.ai)
```

## Key Information

- **Company**: 尚贤智启科技有限公司 (Shangxian AI Technology Co., Ltd.)
- **Domain**: www.shangxian.ai
- **Content Language**: Chinese (Simplified)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (indicated by CNAME file)

## Website Architecture

The website is a single-page application built with:
- **HTML5** with semantic structure
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN) for styling
- **Custom CSS** with extensive ink-painting inspired design elements
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactions and animations
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

### Key Features

1. **Traditional Chinese Design Elements**:
   - Ink painting (水墨) aesthetic with custom SVG backgrounds
   - Calligraphy-inspired typography using 'Noto Serif SC' and 'Noto Sans SC'
   - Traditional decorative elements (brush strokes, seals, bamboo textures)

2. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Extensive mobile-specific CSS classes
   - Touch-friendly interactions
   - Responsive navigation menu
   - Performance optimizations for mobile devices

3. **Content Sections**:
   - Hero section with company slogan
   - Core products (备课辅助, 自动化答疑, 作业测评)
   - Solutions (CourseMaker, EduGenius frameworks)
   - Customer testimonials
   - About us and contact information

## Development Notes

- **AI-Generated Content**: The homepage is generated from README.md content using AI
- **No build process**: Static HTML website with no package.json or build tools
- **CDN Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS is loaded from CDN
- **Font Loading**: Google Fonts (Noto family) for Chinese typography
- **Deployment**: Automatically deployed via GitHub Pages to www.shangxian.ai

## Content Management

- **Source Content**: README.md contains the master content used for AI generation
- **Generated Content**: docs/index.html is AI-generated from README.md
- All content is in Chinese covering company profile, products, solutions, philosophy, and partnerships
- Company information includes Macau University address
- Contact details include social media (小红书, TikTok) and email

## Technical Considerations

- Heavy use of inline SVG for decorative elements
- Custom CSS variables for consistent theming
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations
- Touch event handling for mobile interactions
- No external JavaScript dependencies beyond Tailwind CSS

## Common Tasks

Since this website uses AI-generated content, typical development tasks would involve:
- **Content Updates**: Modify README.md and regenerate docs/index.html using AI
- **Direct HTML Editing**: Edit docs/index.html for styling or structure changes
- **Styling Updates**: Modify the embedded `<style>` section for design changes
- **JavaScript Modifications**: Update the embedded `<script>` section for behavior changes
- **Responsive Testing**: Test design across devices, especially mobile
- **Chinese Typography**: Ensure proper Chinese font rendering and readability

## Content Update Workflow

1. Update company information, products, or solutions in README.md
2. Use AI to regenerate docs/index.html based on updated README.md content
3. Review and test the generated website
4. Commit changes to deploy via GitHub Pages
